<li>Currently I have been obsessed with playing candy crush and sudoku on my phone.</li>
<li>I love spending time hiking and doing activities outdoors. Last summer Kyle and I did a lot of hiking which was awesome. I took this lovely photo in Door County, WI.

<li>I love going to UW-Madison and being a Badger. I find most of my classes to be very fulfilling and feel I learn real world skills. I also love the social environment on campus and sense of community, especially on game days.</li>
