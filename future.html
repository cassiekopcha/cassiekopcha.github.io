<p class="future">
<strong class="big">Career.</strong> I would love to find a career path where I can be creative but also make an impact. This summer I will be starting a Digital Media Internship with Lessiter Media in Brookfield, WI and I am very excited to see where this opportunity leads me. 
</p>

<p class="future">
<strong class="big">Travel.</strong> In the future I want to travel as much as possible. I realize I haven’t even seen most of the United States so I want to start there and travel to different national parks and cities I’ve never been before. I hope to eventually visit different countries and continents as well like Greece, Italy, Scotland, Australia, and Thailand.
</p>

<p class="future">
<strong class="big">Family.</strong> I hope that one day I will start a family of my own and be fortunate enough to be surrounded by loved ones. Included in my family, I will of course need a dog to keep my company
