<li>I love going to the movie theater. The most recent movies I have seen at the theater are The Batman, Uncharted, and Licorice Pizza. When I can’t get to the movie theater itself, I enjoy staying home and watching movies on the million different streaming services out there (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max. Amazon Prime, Peacock, etc.). It’s hard to pick a favorite movie, but some of my tops are Always Be My Maybe, Forrest Gump, and Hercules.
</li>
<li>I have always enjoyed reading books. The most recent books I’ve read are Outlander, Ice, and the Red Dragon. Some of my favorite books that I’ve read are Beloved, the Percy Jackson series, Pride and Prejudice, and Looking for Alaska.

<li>One of my favorite things to do is try new foods. One of my favorite parts of going to UW-Madison is all of the awesome small business are restaurants here. Some of my favorite foods right now are Bagels and Cream Cheese, Mac and Cheese, Chicken sandwiches, Gyoza, and Guacamole.

<li>A clear way to understand what culture is like is by looking at <a href= "https://pin.it/7lfFNxX"> the clothes people wear.</a> In 2022, most people dress for comfort and matching sweatpants/sweatshirt sets are very popular. I wear a lot of leggings, mom jeans, flannels, oversized shirts, crop tops, and layered items. Right now, my favorite trend using claw clips to keep my hair up. I think it’s so cute and very functional.</li>
